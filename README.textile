h2. io libraries from clojure.contrib working with Clojure 1.3

I could not find modules for the following libraries. We were using these for a clojure workshop, hence this is a straight forward port of these to make them run with Clojure 1.3.
* clojure.contrib.io
* clojure.contrib.http.agent
* clojure.contrib.http.connection

The jar is currently not available in any publicly available maven repo. We have installed it in a private repo to make it work with leiningen.
