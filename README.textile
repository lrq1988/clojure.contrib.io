h2. io libraries from clojure.contrib working with Clojure 1.3

I could not find modules for the following libraries. We were using these for a clojure workshop, hence this is a straight forward port of these to make them run with Clojure 1.3.
* clojure.contrib.io
* clojure.contrib.http.agent
* clojure.contrib.http.connection

The jar is currently not available in any publicly available maven repo. We have installed it in a private repo to make it work with leiningen.

h2. The sources of these libraries are clojure.contrib

Just to make it clear, I cannot take any credit for this. All I have done is to do a trivial migrarion to make them work with Clojure 1.3. The sources of the code is https://github.com/clojure/clojure-contrib, and I used the 1.2.0 branch for source of my modifications.

The same as clojure.contrb.
